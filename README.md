# Ingenia - Java Coding Challenge

Coding challenge for Ingenia.
This small API aims to store stations and the paths between them (each path having a different cost), and find the optimal path between two stations.
The optimal path is found using a slightly-modified version of [Dijkstra's algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dijkstra%27s_algorithm).
